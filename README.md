# PDS Assignment-2

Question 1.a
#

I initially stored 25 randomly selected observations from the population into the sample.
Next, we determined the sample's and the population's mean and maximum glucose readings.
The different glucose data for the population and the sample were then plotted using a barplots using these values.

#
Question 1.b
#

I've written a function to calculate the sample's and the population's BMI values at the 98th percentile.
Afterward, these results were shown on a barplot that shows the BMI values for the sample and the population at the 98th percentile.

#
Question 1.c
#

In order to get the average mean, standard deviation, and percentile for BloodPressure, we produced 500 samples from the population, each with 150 observations, using
bootstrap (replace=True).
These values have been determined and shown on the respective barplots. The 95th percentile, mean, standard deviation, and other statistics for the 'BloodPressure'
variable from the bootstrap samples closely resemble those from the population, as can be seen from the graph. This demonstrates that the bootstrap samples are
representative of the population for the 'BloodPressure' variable and that the sample statistics are precise approximations of the population statistics. The results may
not necessarily apply to other datasets or populations, it is crucial to keep in mind, since they are dependent on the unique dataset utilized in this investigation.
Always consider the results' interpretation carefully in light of the specific circumstances in which the data were gathered.
